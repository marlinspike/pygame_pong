### Pong
A basic Pong clone written using Python and PyGame. This is a deceptively simple game to build with kids -- several flips of vector dictions based upon ball bounces. Super fun to play.

### Requirements
- Pygame

### Gameplay
This is the basic *Pong* as I remembered it as a kid! It's great fun to play, and easy to get into. Gameplay is elementary -- prevent your opponent from scoring a goal against you.

**Points:**
* 10 for a goal
* Minus 10 for a goal scored agianst you
